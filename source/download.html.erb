  <h1>Warning</h1>
  <p>
    GuitarGeeksVR is currently in an early <em>alpha</em> state, and will likely have a few bugs.
    Furthermore, the VR experience is not yet very smooth due to some issues of the Oculus Rift library.
    Until these issues are resolved, you will probably experience some <em>judder</em>.
    In the <%=link_to "documentation", "documentation.html"%> you can find a few tips, which may help to optimize the experience.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Download</h1>

    If you are a Windows user and you do not have a JRE installed, we have special versions for you which are bundled with a JRE (the version differ in the JRE only, which is either 32 bit or 64 bit).
    If you already have JRE, you can pick the cross platform version.
    This version should work for all platforms: Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
